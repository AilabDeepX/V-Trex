# 1. Introduction üìö
Object detection, the ability to locate and identify objects within an image, is a cornerstone of computer vision, pivotal to applications ranging from autonomous driving to content moderation. A notable limitation of traditional object detection models is their closed-set nature. These models are trained on a predetermined set of categories, confining their ability to recognize only those specific categories. The training process itself is arduous, demanding expert knowledge, extensive datasets, and intricate model tuning to achieve desirable accuracy. Moreover, the introduction of a novel object category, exacerbates these challenges, necessitating the entire process to be repeated.

T-Rex2 addresses these limitations by integrating both text and visual prompts in one model, thereby harnessing the strengths of both modalities. The synergy of text and visual prompts equips T-Rex2 with robust zero-shot capabilities, making it a versatile tool in the ever-changing landscape of object detection.

## What Can V-TRex Do üìù
T-Rex2 is well-suited for a variety of real-world applications, including but not limited to: agriculture, industry, livstock and wild animals monitoring, biology, medicine, OCR, retail, electronics, transportation, logistics, and more. T-Rex2 mainly supports three major workflows including interactive visual prompt workflow, generic visual prompt workflow and text prompt workflow. It can cover most of the application scenarios that require object detection
